In this tutorial, you will learn how to import a dataset, filter the data, and create visualizations using Pandas to explore and analyze it. Specifically, we will work with a dataset containing U.S. cancer incidence counts (1999–2022), grouped by race, cancer site, age group, and sex.

## Introduction to the Data

As mentioned in the blog introduction, we will be working with a dataset containing U.S. cancer incidence counts from 1999 to 2022.

The dataset includes the following variables:

- **Race**: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, White, and Other.
- **Cancer site**: The location of the cancer, such as stomach, small intestine, tonsil, salivary gland, and others.
- **Age**: Grouped into 4-year intervals from <1 in some cases to 85+ (e.g., 20–24, 25–29, etc.).
- **Rates**: Calculated per 100,000 people.

The dataset contains 12,532 rows and represents a subset of all cancer data collected during this period.

### United States and Puerto Rico Cancer Statistics, 1999-2022 Incidence

| Race                      | Code  | Cancer Site                                       | Site Code | Age Group    | Age Code | Sex    | Sex Code | Count |
|---------------------------|:-----:|--------------------------------------------------|:---------:|:------------|:--------:|:------:|:--------:|------:|
| Asian or Pacific Islander | A-PI  | Lung and Bronchus                                | 22030     | 85+ years    | 85       | Female | F        |  5305 |
| Asian or Pacific Islander | A-PI  | Lung and Bronchus                                | 22030     | 85+ years    | 85       | Male   | M        |  5773 |
| Asian or Pacific Islander | A-PI  | Trachea, Mediastinum and Other Respiratory Organs | 22060     | 1-4 years    | 1-4     | Female | F        |    16 |
| Asian or Pacific Islander | A-PI  | Trachea, Mediastinum and Other Respiratory Organs | 22060     | 15-19 years  | 15-19   | Male   | M        |    53 |



## Loading in the Data
Now that we understand what we are working with, we can load in the data. In Pandas, we can read in a CSV file with the following code **(click on the dropdown arrow beside the word `code` to see the code and comments that explain how the code works)**:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("cancer.csv") ## this reads in the CSV
df.head() ## this shows the first five rows
```
## Filtering the Data

Sometimes, we might work with data that is not relevant to our analysis. For this data set, let's say we are only interested in specific cancer types and known races, so we will exclude entries where the cancer type is "All Invasive Cancer Sites Combined" and where the race is "Other Races and Unknown combined". This allows us to focus on the cancers and races of interest.

Additionally, the dataset contains a "Notes" column that does not contain any useful data, so we will remove it.

Note that spelling is crucial in this step. In this dataset, "All Invasive Cancer Sites Combined" uses an uppercase "C" in "Combined," whereas "Other Races and Unknown combined" uses a lowercase "c."

**Click on the dropdown arrow beside the word `code`below to see the code and comments that exolain how the code works. You will need to do this for the rest of the tutorial**:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("cancer.csv")

# Filter the rows to exclude "All Invasive Cancer Sites Combined" and "Other Races and Unknown combined"
df_filtered = df[
    (df['Cancer Sites'] != "All Invasive Cancer Sites Combined") &
    (df['Race'] != "Other Races and Unknown combined")
]

# eliminate the Notes column using the .drop() method
df_filtered = df_filtered.drop(columns=['Notes'])

# eliminate rows where all remaining values are NaN
df_filtered = df_filtered.dropna(how='all')

# Display the filtered data
df_filtered
```

## Plotting with Pandas

Now that we have our data cleaned and ready, it is time to explore some of Pandas' visualization tools. In this tutorial, we will specifically look at the following plots:

1. Bar charts  
2. Stacked bar charts  
3. Heatmaps  
4. Pie charts  
5. Scatter plots

### 1. Bar Charts

Bar charts are ideal for grouping cancer counts by variables such as cancer site or race. In Pandas, we can group data, sum the counts, and plot it. The `kind` parameter specifies the type of chart:

```{python}
df_filtered.groupby('Cancer Sites')['Count'].sum().sort_values().plot(kind='bar')
```

This graph is **hard to interpret** because the dataset contains many cancer sites. To make it more readable, we can focus on a subset of cancer sites. I chose: Stomach, Lung and Bronchus, Soft Tissue including Heart, Female Breast, Prostate, Kidney and Renal Pelvis, Brain, and Leukemias. 

Here is the code for that, with accompanying comments. Notice how we create a specific list of sites we want to include and then use the `.isin()` method to filter for them when we generate the plot:

```{python}
# List of specific cancer sites
selected_sites = [
    "Stomach",
    "Lung and Bronchus",
    "Soft Tissue including Heart",
    "Female Breast",
    "Prostate",
    "Kidney and Renal Pelvis",
    "Brain",
    "Leukemias"
]

# Plot only the selected sites using the  .isin() methid
df[df['Cancer Sites'].isin(selected_sites)].groupby('Cancer Sites')['Count'].sum().sort_values().plot(kind='bar')
```

From this chart, we can easily see that certain cancers—such as Lung, Prostate, and Female Breast—are much more prevalent than others like Stomach or Brain cancer.

### 2. Stacked Bar Charts

When we want to visualize how cancer counts are distributed across different groups, such as sex, age, or race, stacked bar charts are useful.

When we make stacked bar charts, we can make use of the `.pivot_table()` method. In `pandas`, a pivot table is similiar to it's Excel counterpart in that it is a way to summarize and aggregate data in a table format by specifying which columns to use as rows, which to use as columns, and which values to aggregate.

```{python}
# List of specific cancer sites, expanded
selected_sites = [
    "Stomach",
    "Lung and Bronchus",
    "Soft Tissue including Heart",
    "Female Breast",
    "Prostate",
    "Kidney and Renal Pelvis",
    "Brain",
    "Leukemias",
    "Oral Cavity and Pharynx",
    "Salivary Gland",
    "Esophagus",
    "Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct",
    "Melanoma of the Skin",
    "Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma",
    "Eye and Orbit",
    "Endocrine System",
    "Thyroid"
]

# Filter for the selected cancer sites using .isin()
df_selected = df_filtered[df_filtered['Cancer Sites'].isin(selected_sites)]

# Pivot table: Cancer Sites x Sex
df_pivot_sex = df_selected.pivot_table(
    index='Cancer Sites', # we want cancer sites to be the rows
    columns='Sex', ## we want sex to be the columns
    values='Count', ## these are the values we want to aggregate
    aggfunc='sum' ## we will aggregate the data by summing them
)

# Plot stacked bar chart
df_pivot_sex.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)
```
This type of chart allows us to analyze patterns by sex. For example, Prostate cancer occurs only in biological males, and Female Breast cancer occurs only in biological females. For other cancers, such as Lung, the counts are similar for both sexes. Cancers of the endocrine system and thyroid appear more prevalent in males, whereas oral cavity and kidney cancers appear to be more common in females.


### 3. Heatmaps

Heatmaps are a powerful way to visualize patterns among two categorical variables. For this data, let's use a heatmap to show which cancer sites have higher counts for different age groups. This makes it easy to spot trends at a glance.

In order to make heatmaps in Pandas, we will need to use the python visualization library `matplotlib`. 

First, let's install matblotlib. In your terminal, run: `pip install matplotlib`.

Next, run the following code to generate a heatmap: 
```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# List of selected cancer sites to make the heatmap easier to read
selected_sites = [
    "Stomach",
    "Lung and Bronchus",
    "Soft Tissue including Heart",
    "Female Breast",
    "Prostate",
    "Kidney and Renal Pelvis",
    "Brain",
    "Leukemias",
    "Oral Cavity and Pharynx",
    "Salivary Gland",
    "Esophagus",
    "Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct",
    "Melanoma of the Skin",
    "Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma",
    "Eye and Orbit",
    "Endocrine System",
    "Thyroid"
]

# Filter the DataFrame to only look at the sites we are interested in using the isin() method
df_selected = df_filtered[df_filtered['Cancer Sites'].isin(selected_sites)]

#Make a pivot table that makes it so that the data frame only contains the information we need.
df_pivot = df_selected.pivot_table(
    index='Cancer Sites', 
    columns='Age Groups', 
    values='Count', 
    aggfunc='sum'
)

# Create the heatmap. Use the color red.
plt.imshow(df_pivot, cmap='Reds')

# Add x and y axis labels; rotate the x labels 90 degress so that they don't overlap one another. 
plt.xticks(range(len(df_pivot.columns)), df_pivot.columns, rotation=90)
plt.yticks(range(len(df_pivot.index)), df_pivot.index)

# Add a colorbar to show the scale
plt.colorbar(label="Count")

plt.show()

```

As you can see, the dark red areas correspond to higher counts. For example, Female Breast cancer, Lung and Bronchus cancer, and Prostate cancer are most prevalent in the 50–85 year age range, with the highest number of Prostate cancer cases occurring in the 65–69 year group.

### 4. Pie Charts

Pie charts are useful for showing how a total count is divided among categories, such as Male vs Female cases for a specific cancer type. They provide a quick visual sense of which group accounts for a larger proportion of cases.

With Pandas, you can create a pie chart directly using the `plot(kind='pie')` method — no need to call `matplotlib` functions.

Here is some code that shows how Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct cancer is distributed across the sexes:

``` {python}
# Filter for Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct cancer
df_liver = df_selected[df_selected['Cancer Sites'] == "Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct"]

# Aggregate counts by sex
counts_by_sex = df_liver.groupby('Sex')['Count'].sum()

# Create the pie chart using Pandas
counts_by_sex.plot(
    kind='pie',        # specify a pie chart
    autopct='%1.1f%%', # show percentages to one decimal point
)

```
### 5. Scatter Plots

The last graph we’ll look at is a scatter plot, which shows the relationship between two numbers by plotting each data point as a dot. Here, we’ll use it to see how Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct cancer counts are spread across different age groups: <1 year, 1–4 years, …, 80–84 years, and 85+ years.

```{python}

# Make the age categories into numbers first
ages = {
    "< 1 year": 0,
    "1-4 years": 2.5,
    "5-9 years": 7,
    "10-14 years": 12,
    "15-19 years": 17,
    "20-24 years": 22,
    "25-29 years": 27,
    "30-34 years": 32,
    "35-39 years": 37,
    "40-44 years": 42,
    "45-49 years": 47,
    "50-54 years": 52,
    "55-59 years": 57,
    "60-64 years": 62,
    "65-69 years": 67,
    "70-74 years": 72,
    "75-79 years": 77,
    "80-84 years": 82,
    "85+ years": 90
}

## use on the data where the cancer site is liver cancer. Don't chage the original data, just take a copy. 
df_liver = df_selected[df_selected['Cancer Sites'] == "Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct"].copy()

## Replace each age range in the data frame with a numberic value that represents that age range.
df_liver['Age Groups'] = df_liver['Age Groups'].map(ages)

# create the scatter plot with the following axes
df_liver.plot.scatter(x='Age Groups', y='Count')

```
This scatterplot shows cancer case counts by age. The vertical spread at each age reflects differences between demographic groups and cancer types, but the clear overall trend is that liver cancer incidence increases sharply with age.

 ## Going Further with Graphing

In this tutorial, we covered how to plot data using `pandas`. When we introduced the heatmap, we mentioned the Python library `matplotlib`. You can explore the wide variety of plot types available in `matplotlib` [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html).

Additionally, there are many ways to enhance your graphs, such as changing colors, adjusting axes, and more.  

Here is an example of how we might do that with a pie chart. Click on the `code` arrow to view the changes we made: 

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Filter for Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct cancer
df_liver = df_selected[df_selected['Cancer Sites'] == "Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct"]

# Aggregate counts by sex
counts_by_sex = df_liver.groupby('Sex')['Count'].sum()

# Create the pie chart and get the Axes object
ax = counts_by_sex.plot(
    kind='pie',
    autopct='%1.1f%%',
    colors=['pink', 'lightskyblue'],
    ylabel=''  # removes default y-axis label
)

# Set the styled title
ax.set_title(
    "Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer by Sex",
    fontsize=16,
    fontweight='bold',
    color='mediumorchid'
)

# Show the plot cleanly
plt.show()

```
