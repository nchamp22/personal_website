    "section": "Plotting with Pandas",
    "text": "Plotting with Pandas\nNow that we have our data cleaned and ready, it is time to explore some of Pandas’ visualization tools. In this tutorial, we will specifically look at the following plots:\n\nBar charts\n\nStacked bar charts\n\nHeatmaps\n\nPie charts\n\nScatter plots\n\n\n1. Bar Charts\nBar charts are ideal for grouping cancer counts by variables such as cancer site or race. In Pandas, we can group data, sum the counts, and plot it. The kind parameter specifies the type of chart:\n\n\nCode\ndf_filtered.groupby('Cancer Sites')['Count'].sum().sort_values().plot(kind='bar')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph is hard to interpret because the dataset contains many cancer sites. To make it more readable, we can focus on a subset of cancer sites. I chose: Stomach, Lung and Bronchus, Soft Tissue including Heart, Female Breast, Prostate, Kidney and Renal Pelvis, Brain, and Leukemias.\nHere is the code for that, with accompanying comments. Notice how we create a specific list of sites we want to include and then use the .isin() method to filter for them when we generate the plot:\n\n\nCode\n# List of specific cancer sites\nselected_sites = [\n    \"Stomach\",\n    \"Lung and Bronchus\",\n    \"Soft Tissue including Heart\",\n    \"Female Breast\",\n    \"Prostate\",\n    \"Kidney and Renal Pelvis\",\n    \"Brain\",\n    \"Leukemias\"\n]\n\n# Plot only the selected sites using the  .isin() methid\ndf[df['Cancer Sites'].isin(selected_sites)].groupby('Cancer Sites')['Count'].sum().sort_values().plot(kind='bar')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this chart, we can easily see that certain cancers—such as Lung, Prostate, and Female Breast—are much more prevalent than others like Stomach or Brain cancer.\n\n\n2. Stacked Bar Charts\nWhen we want to visualize how cancer counts are distributed across different groups, such as sex, age, or race, stacked bar charts are useful.\nWhen we make stacked bar charts, we can make use of the .pivot_table() method. In pandas, a pivot table is similiar to it’s Excel counterpart in that it is a way to summarize and aggregate data in a table format by specifying which columns to use as rows, which to use as columns, and which values to aggregate.\n\n\nCode\n# List of specific cancer sites, expanded\nselected_sites = [\n    \"Stomach\",\n    \"Lung and Bronchus\",\n    \"Soft Tissue including Heart\",\n    \"Female Breast\",\n    \"Prostate\",\n    \"Kidney and Renal Pelvis\",\n    \"Brain\",\n    \"Leukemias\",\n    \"Oral Cavity and Pharynx\",\n    \"Salivary Gland\",\n    \"Esophagus\",\n    \"Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct\",\n    \"Melanoma of the Skin\",\n    \"Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\",\n    \"Eye and Orbit\",\n    \"Endocrine System\",\n    \"Thyroid\"\n]\n\n# Filter for the selected cancer sites using .isin()\ndf_selected = df_filtered[df_filtered['Cancer Sites'].isin(selected_sites)]\n\n# Pivot table: Cancer Sites x Sex\ndf_pivot_sex = df_selected.pivot_table(\n    index='Cancer Sites', # we want cancer sites to be the rows\n    columns='Sex', ## we want sex to be the columns\n    values='Count', ## these are the values we want to aggregate\n    aggfunc='sum' ## we will aggregate the data by summing them\n)\n\n# Plot stacked bar chart\ndf_pivot_sex.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis type of chart allows us to analyze patterns by sex. For example, Prostate cancer occurs only in biological males, and Female Breast cancer occurs only in biological females. For other cancers, such as Lung, the counts are similar for both sexes. Cancers of the endocrine system and thyroid appear more prevalent in males, whereas oral cavity and kidney cancers appear to be more common in females.\n\n\n3. Heatmaps\nHeatmaps are a powerful way to visualize patterns among two categorical variables. For this data, let’s use a heatmap to show which cancer sites have higher counts for different age groups. This makes it easy to spot trends at a glance.\nIn order to make heatmaps in Pandas, we will need to use the python visualization library matplotlib.\nFirst, let’s install matblotlib. In your terminal, run: pip install matplotlib.\nNext, run the following code to generate a heatmap:\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# List of selected cancer sites to make the heatmap easier to read\nselected_sites = [\n    \"Stomach\",\n    \"Lung and Bronchus\",\n    \"Soft Tissue including Heart\",\n    \"Female Breast\",\n    \"Prostate\",\n    \"Kidney and Renal Pelvis\",\n    \"Brain\",\n    \"Leukemias\",\n    \"Oral Cavity and Pharynx\",\n    \"Salivary Gland\",\n    \"Esophagus\",\n    \"Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct\",\n    \"Melanoma of the Skin\",\n    \"Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\",\n    \"Eye and Orbit\",\n    \"Endocrine System\",\n    \"Thyroid\"\n]\n\n# Filter the DataFrame to only look at the sites we are interested in using the isin() method\ndf_selected = df_filtered[df_filtered['Cancer Sites'].isin(selected_sites)]\n\n#Make a pivot table that makes it so that the data frame only contains the information we need.\ndf_pivot = df_selected.pivot_table(\n    index='Cancer Sites', \n    columns='Age Groups', \n    values='Count', \n    aggfunc='sum'\n)\n\n# Create the heatmap. Use the color red.\nplt.imshow(df_pivot, cmap='Reds')\n\n# Add x and y axis labels; rotate the x labels 90 degress so that they don't overlap one another. \nplt.xticks(range(len(df_pivot.columns)), df_pivot.columns, rotation=90)\nplt.yticks(range(len(df_pivot.index)), df_pivot.index)\n\n# Add a colorbar to show the scale\nplt.colorbar(label=\"Count\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the dark red areas correspond to higher counts. For example, Female Breast cancer, Lung and Bronchus cancer, and Prostate cancer are most prevalent in the 50–85 year age range, with the highest number of Prostate cancer cases occurring in the 65–69 year group.\n\n\n4. Pie Charts\nPie charts are useful for showing how a total count is divided among categories, such as Male vs Female cases for a specific cancer type. They provide a quick visual sense of which group accounts for a larger proportion of cases.\nWith Pandas, you can create a pie chart directly using the plot(kind='pie') method — no need to call matplotlib functions.\nHere is some code that shows how Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct cancer is distributed across the sexes:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct cancer\ndf_liver = df_selected[df_selected['Cancer Sites'] == \"Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct\"]\n\n# Aggregate counts by sex\ncounts_by_sex = df_liver.groupby('Sex')['Count'].sum()\n\n# Create the pie chart using Pandas\ncounts_by_sex.plot(\n    kind='pie',        # specify a pie chart\n    autopct='%1.1f%%', # show percentages to one decimal point\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Scatter Plots\nThe last graph we’ll look at is a scatter plot, which shows the relationship between two numbers by plotting each data point as a dot. Here, we’ll use it to see how Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct cancer counts are spread across different age groups: &lt;1 year, 1–4 years, …, 80–84 years, and 85+ years.\n\n\nCode\n# Make the age categories into numbers first\nages = {\n    \"&lt; 1 year\": 0,\n    \"1-4 years\": 2.5,\n    \"5-9 years\": 7,\n    \"10-14 years\": 12,\n    \"15-19 years\": 17,\n    \"20-24 years\": 22,\n    \"25-29 years\": 27,\n    \"30-34 years\": 32,\n    \"35-39 years\": 37,\n    \"40-44 years\": 42,\n    \"45-49 years\": 47,\n    \"50-54 years\": 52,\n    \"55-59 years\": 57,\n    \"60-64 years\": 62,\n    \"65-69 years\": 67,\n    \"70-74 years\": 72,\n    \"75-79 years\": 77,\n    \"80-84 years\": 82,\n    \"85+ years\": 90\n}\n\n## use on the data where the cancer site is liver cancer. Don't chage the original data, just take a copy. \ndf_liver = df_selected[df_selected['Cancer Sites'] == \"Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct\"].copy()\n\n## Replace each age range in the data frame with a numberic value that represents that age range.\ndf_liver['Age Groups'] = df_liver['Age Groups'].map(ages)\n\n# create the scatter plot with the following axes\ndf_liver.plot.scatter(x='Age Groups', y='Count')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatterplot shows cancer case counts by age. The vertical spread at each age reflects differences between demographic groups and cancer types, but the clear overall trend is that liver cancer incidence increases sharply with age.\n## Going Further with Graphing\nIn this tutorial, we covered how to plot data using pandas. When we introduced the heatmap, we mentioned the Python library matplotlib. You can explore the wide variety of plot types available in matplotlib here.\nAdditionally, there are many ways to enhance your graphs, such as changing colors, adjusting axes, and more.\nHere is an example of how we might do that with a pie chart. Click on the code arrow to view the changes we made:\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Filter for Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct cancer\ndf_liver = df_selected[df_selected['Cancer Sites'] == \"Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct\"]\n\n# Aggregate counts by sex\ncounts_by_sex = df_liver.groupby('Sex')['Count'].sum()\n\n# Create the pie chart and get the Axes object\nax = counts_by_sex.plot(\n    kind='pie',\n    autopct='%1.1f%%',\n    colors=['pink', 'lightskyblue'],\n    ylabel=''  # removes default y-axis label\n)\n\n# Set the styled title\nax.set_title(\n    \"Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer by Sex\",\n    fontsize=16,\n    fontweight='bold',\n    color='mediumorchid'\n)\n\n# Show the plot cleanly\nplt.show()"
